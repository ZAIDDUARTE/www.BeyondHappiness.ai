          Arizona State University(opens in a new window) (ASU) is one of the
          largest public universities in the United States, serving 181,000
          students in a given year and offering over 800 degree options. For
          nine straight years, U.S. News and World Report has named ASU the most
          innovative university in America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, ASU is enhancing educational outcomes by integrating ChatGPT
          Edu into projects across teaching, research, and operations. Guided by
          the ASU charter, which prioritizes inclusion over exclusion, research
          benefiting the public, and responsibility for the communities they
          serve, ASU collaborates with OpenAI to use technology to deliver
          lifelong learning and drive human potential at a social scale.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">
          Democratizing higher education and creating 'lifelong learners'
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the spring of 2024, ASU graduated 20,000 students—its largest class
          yet. “No two people learn in exactly the same way, and innovation has
          proven to be the most powerful asset that we have,” says Michael M.
          Crow, President of ASU. “Essential to ASU’s success is that we use
          technology, and now AI, to deliver lifelong learning and to drive
          human potential.”
        </p>
        <p>
          By bringing ChatGPT into higher education, ASU is setting a new
          precedent for universities to enhance learning, creativity, and
          student outcomes while remaining committed to leading in innovation
          and responsible use of technology. President Crow envisions a future
          where AI will continue transforming higher education, making it more
          personalized and inclusive. “Higher education in 50 years will be
          highly diversified, technologically enhanced, and throughout a
          person’s life.”
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">
          Deploying ChatGPT in over 200 projects
        </h2>
        <p>
          ASU adopted ChatGPT the same way it adopted other technology: by being
          intentional about its impact. “What we’ve learned at ASU is that if
          you want to focus on the impact of technology, start by asking the
          community what they want to solve for,” says Lev Gonick, ASU’s Chief
          Information Officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AI Innovation Challenge(opens in a new window) was a product of
          this mindset. In February 2024, ASU invited faculty and staff to
          submit proposals for using ChatGPT to maximize their teaching,
          research, and operations. Submissions required a clear plan for
          integrating ChatGPT into one of three priority areas:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            Supporting teaching and learning: Proposals that enhance the
            educational experience for students and faculty within a class
            setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advancing research for public good: Proposals that support
            student—and faculty-led research that demonstrate a clear path to
            making meaningful community and planet contributions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhancing the future of work: Proposals that contribute to a more
            positive, productive, and supportive work environment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Within weeks, the ASU team received proposals representing more than
          80% of ASU’s schools and colleges. “We thought we’d get a few early
          adopters,” says Gonick. “Our few adopters quickly became hundreds of
          faculty interested in using ChatGPT for research and in the
          classroom.” The demand was so high that in March, ASU initiated a
          second round of proposals that included student researchers.
